    "## Terraforming Mars Cost-Benefit Analysis\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Terraforming Mars is a competitive board game developed by Jacob Fryxelius and published by FryxGames in 2016. Players take on the role of corporations tasked with making Mars habitable through the raising of the oxygen level, temperature, and ocean coverage, as well as sundry other projects to progress humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently sitting at #4 on BoardGameGeek's ranked board game list, Terraforming Mars has found broad popularity among strategy board gamers in large part due to its variety and complexity. With 208 unique cards and 12 distinct corporations, players are put into an endless assortment of scenarios. This incredible depth means that players must often intuit their next move rather than deduce it from values and probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bid to add more deduction back into the equation, this analysis aims to take every card in Terraforming Mars and boil it down to a single value in credits (the game's main resource) for simple value-comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."
